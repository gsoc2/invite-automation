## How to join the Maintainers Organization
1. Star this repository
2. Once you star this repository, an issue will be opened for your pending invitation
3. In the issue, you will be prompted to answer the following questions! (This will help us identify if you're a maintainer vs. a spammer or a bot)
  - [ ] What is the name of the project you maintain?
  - [ ] What is the URL to your GitHub repository?
  - [ ] Why do you want to join the maintainers organization? (Please be specific)
4. You will receive an automated message that one of the admins will be reviewing your request to join.
5. Once reviewed, an approved adminstrator will approve or deny your request
6. Within 48 hours of the approved request, you will be admitted into the maintainers organization.
